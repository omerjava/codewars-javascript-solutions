/* A square of squares
You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even 
like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! 
Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! 
That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

Task
Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:
