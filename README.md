# codewars-javascript-solutions

- You can find in this repository my JavaScript solutions to [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard) challenges.
- The solutions I shared here passed the tests in [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard).
- But, some of the solutions are not completed yet and there is a `// not solved yet` warning as a comment.
- I uploaded my codes without refactoring deliberately to see in future how my coding skills improved. 
- They can be refactored sure! I will refactor my codes and commit in here!
- There will be constant refactoring.
- I will be adding new solution codes to here continuously.
